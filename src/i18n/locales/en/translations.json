    "working_with_data": "I've learned from working with data that there's always a story behind it. Sometimes it is a seemingly boring story, which we flip through with more and more difficulty, to be finally delighted with the bizarre twist of the plot. At other times, it's a fascinating and agile short story, the ending of which leaves you at a crossroads with the feeling that neither of them has a good end. Most often, however, it is the prose of life that makes us play the role of the main narrator and put together something out of torn pieces. And each of them is a hero who came here from a completely different story.",

By all means for me. There was one direction. Forward. So I started my march. I started gaining knowledge and experience in small steps. Or I would rather say the experience and acquired knowledge.</0><1>The first job in trade showed how the heart of every business works. In particular, that it is people who do business, not products or services. I also realized an important thing - that I can do anything I want to. So?</1><2>Change of job. Logistics. It allowed me to develop my analytical skills and practice what I had known only in theory. I felt that my professional workshop was finally gaining value. Time was rushing inexorably in the only direction it knew, bringing successive changes. It included a new job.</2><3>Data analysis. From then on, my professional tasks focused on this. It seemed that I was rushing forward, and the world slowed down. I lived with the feeling that there were no impossible tasks or unsolvable problems. I thought this was my place on Earth. Unfortunately. By clinging to this piece of dry land, I missed out on the currents that the world travelled towards an unknown tomorrow.</3> <4>I woke up. I was already in a new reality dominated by artificial intelligence and machine learning. What about me? As if I were starting everything from scratch. I realized that I didn't know much again.</4> <5>With one difference - today, I know what I don't know. And this comes more every day... Honestly? I'm happy about this. After all, you only develop when you learn something!</5>",
